Dr. Ramesh Nayaka is an **Assistant Professor** in the Department of **Civil and Infrastructure Engineering** at **IIT Dharwad**. He earned his **Ph.D. in Structural Engineering and Materials** from the **University of Malaya (UM), Malaysia (2016–2019)**, where he was honored with the **Thesis Excellence Award in 2019**. He holds an **M.Tech. in Civil Engineering** from IIT Madras (2011–2013) and a **B.Eng. in Civil Engineering** from VTU Karnataka (BEC Bagalkot, 2007–2011).

Dr. Nayaka specializes in **structural engineering**, with a strong research focus on **value-addition analysis, material innovations, structural behavior of systems, and advancements in construction technology**. His ongoing research projects explore **3D Concrete Printing Technology**, **innovative design and behavior of structural system**s, and the development of **free-form and sustainable structural elements**. His studies further investigate composite materials and sustainable construction solutions, integrating BIM-driven Framework for Sustanability Audit (Environmental and Cost) and A**I/ML applications for Structural Health Monitoring and Stability Analysis of Important Infrastructures (Bridges and Dams)**. 

Before joining IIT Dharwad, Dr. Nayaka served as an Assistant Professor at NIT Warangal (2019–2023), MAHE Manipal (2014-16, 2019), and NIT Calicut (Ad-hoc, 2013). With over a decade of academic and research experience, he has mentored over 24 PG dissertations and six UG final-year projects, and currently supervises ten Ph.D. scholars. He has also evaluated more than five Ph.D. theses and over 30 PG dissertations.

His research is supported by funding agencies, focusing on projects such as: Sustainable 3D Concrete Printing for Structural Systems, Sustainable Building Envelop Systems, Stability Analysis of Dam; Materails Characterisation, BIM-based Life Cycle Cost and Environmental Assessments for FRC and FRP systems; Affordable Housing Solutions; Self-Healing Concrete and Autoclaved Aerated Concrete. Dr. Nayaka has published his research in high-impact journals and actively contributes to national and international academic collaborations.
